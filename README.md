# Spam Detection with BERT and Custom Attention

This repository contains the implementation of a spam detection model using a modified BERT architecture enhanced with a custom attention mechanism. The model is designed to classify SMS messages or emails into 'spam' or 'not spam' categories.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Script for training the model on a provided dataset.
- `test.py`: Script for testing the trained model on a separate dataset.
- `utils.py`: Contains configuration settings and utility functions.
- `model.py`: Definition of the ModifiedBERT model with custom attention layer.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies needed to run the project.
